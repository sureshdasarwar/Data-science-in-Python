# Data-science-in-Python
My Academic Project on Data Science using Python 

The main objective of this project is to collect the dataset from the web APIs
and use Python to Pre-Process and Analysis the collected Data. In other technical
words it can be called as Web Scrapping and Visualization of the some interesting
pattern from the processed dataset.

The web-API which I have chosen is from fixer.io and the website is https://fixer.io/
this web-api gives the real time exchange rate for the available currencies
It has 1000 api calls and the data is hourly updated.

Tasks Completed:
1. collecting the data from the web-API using Python. 
2. Parse the collected data and store it in an appropriate format.
3. Load and represent the data using data structure, clean and filter the data.
4. Remove the NUll values and Missing values.
5. Data visualization for selected data and plotting the graphs.
